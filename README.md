# Predict-Diabetes-with-Machine-Learning

Based on the latest data provided by the Centers for Disease Control and Prevention, it is currently estimated that approximately one out of every seven adults living in the United States is affected by diabetes. However, projections indicate that this prevalence could potentially increase in the coming years. Given this growing concern, today's article aims to explore and demonstrate how you can leverage the power of machine learning techniques to predict the likelihood of diabetes using the Python programming language. Through this guide, we will delve into practical methods and tools to help you harness machine learning for early detection and analysis of diabetes trends.
